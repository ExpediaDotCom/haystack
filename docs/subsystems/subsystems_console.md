[Haystack Console](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack-console/) is a interface for managing and observing the health of a deployed Haystack cluster. The cluster works hand-in-hand with the [attributor](./subsystems_attribution.html) to facilitate changes needed to maintain a healthy deployment. More information coming soon.
