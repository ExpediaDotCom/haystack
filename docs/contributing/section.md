 ### Development

 All work on Haystack happens directly on Github. Core Haystack team members will review opened pull requests.

 ### Requests

 If you see a feature that you would like to be added, please open an issue in the respective repository or in the general [Haystack](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack/issues) repo.

 ### Adding to Documentation

 The documentation uses [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) as an organizational framework. The documentation source can be found on the gh-pages branch in the [base haystack repository](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack/).

 For generating `gitbook` styled pages, you can use [generate_docsite.sh](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack/blob/master/docs/generate_docsite.sh). After generating pages, they should be pused out to `gh-pages`
 branch for publishing on [expediadotcom.github.io/haystack](https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack)
