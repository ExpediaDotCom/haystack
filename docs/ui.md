Visualization tools in haystack-ui include -
* [Traces](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack) - Distributed tracing visualization for easy root cause analysis 
* [Trends](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack) - Visualization for vital service trends 
* [Alerts and Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack) - UI for configuring and subscribing alerts 
* **Service Dependency** [coming soon] - Real time dependency graph with health and connectivity indicators 

Navigation in `haystack-ui` is pivoted around services. On selecting a service, you will get various visualizations tools each corresponding to a haystack sub-system.
