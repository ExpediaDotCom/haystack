The `haystack-ui` project is the web UI for haystack. It is the central place for visualizing processed data from various haystack sub-systems.

Visualization tools in haystack-ui include -
* [Traces](https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack/docs/ui_traces.html) - Distributed tracing visualization for easy root cause analysis 
* [Trends](https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack/docs/ui_trends.html) - Visualization for vital service trends 
* [Alerts and Anomaly Detection](https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack/docs/ui_alerts.html) - UI for configuring and subscribing alerts 
* **Service Dependency** [coming soon] - Real time dependency graph with health and connectivity indicators 

Navigation in `haystack-ui` is pivoted around services. On selecting a service, you will get various visualizations tools each corresponding to a haystack sub-system.
