# Contributing to Haystack

### Bugs

We use [Github Issues](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack-ui/issues) for our bug reporting. Please make sure the bug isn't already listed before opening a new issue.

### Development

All work on Haystack happens directly on Github. Core Haystack team members will review opened pull requests.

### Requests

If you see a feature that you would like to be added, please open an issue in the respective repository or in the general [Haystack](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack/issues) repo.

### Contributing in Documentation

For contributing in documentation, you can directly modify the corresponding .md files in the `docs` directory under the [base haystack repository](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack/) and submit a pull request. Once your PR is merged in, the changes are automatically deployed to  <https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack>.
 
The documentation site on <https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack> uses [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to render the documentation. Note that the Table of Contents is maintained manually, in the _includes/sidebar.html file. Update that file if you add new topics or relocate topics in the Table of Contents. 

### License

By contributing to Haystack, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its [Apache License](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack/blob/master/LICENSE).
