# Haystack Deployment
This is a deployment module which uses terraform to automates deployment of Haystack components using 
[Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). You can use this module to 
setup Haystack cluster on your local (Mac/Linux) machine, or on AWS.

## Local Cluster
To get a feel for Haystack you can run Haystack locally inside 
[Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/). For details on local deployment refer to the 
[getting started guide](https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack/docs/about/getting_started.html).

## AWS Cluster
We support out of the box deployment in AWS for Haystack. For the details on deploying Haystack on AWS, refer to the 
following [wiki](https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack/docs/deployment.html).
